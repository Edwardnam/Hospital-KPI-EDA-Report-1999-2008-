# 🏥 Hospital KPI & EDA Report (1999–2008)
![Hospital KPI Dashboard](assets/dashboard.png)

## 📌 Project Background  
As a Data Analyst, I developed a high-level KPI and exploratory data analysis (EDA) dashboard using the **Diabetes 130-US Hospitals dataset**, which spans **ten years of clinical care (1999–2008) across 130 hospitals and integrated delivery networks in the United States**. The dataset includes **101,766 patient encounters** diagnosed with diabetes, with each record containing demographics, admission type, discharge disposition, lab results, medications, and readmission outcomes.  

The goal of this analysis was to uncover **patterns in admissions, readmissions, stay durations, and insurance coverage** to support hospital decision-making. This problem is critical because inadequate diabetes management in hospital settings leads to higher costs, increased readmission rates, and worsened morbidity and mortality among patients.

## 📊 Executive Summary  
This analysis provides a comprehensive view of **hospital operations and patient outcomes** for diabetic patients. Results show that **emergency admissions make up the largest share of encounters**, while **40% of patients are uninsured**, creating financial strain and healthcare access challenges. **Readmission rates peak among seniors (60–80 years)**, with readmitted patients consistently showing **longer lengths of stay** and higher treatment intensity.  

These insights highlight opportunities for hospitals to **improve care coordination, discharge planning, and insurance coverage**, while reducing preventable readmissions and optimizing patient throughput.

## 🔎 Insights Deep-Dive  

### 🧾 Patient Admissions & Readmissions  
- **Emergency admissions dominate (~35%)**, showing high reliance on acute care.  
- **14% of patients are readmitted within 30 days**, with the highest share coming from **seniors (60–80 years)**.  
- Younger patients (0–40) show the **lowest readmission rates**, while older adults drive the majority of repeat visits.  
➡️ Hospitals must prioritize **diabetes management and discharge planning for seniors** to reduce avoidable readmissions.  

---

### ⏱ Length of Stay  
- The **average hospital stay is ~4.5 days**, but readmitted patients consistently show longer durations.  
- Trauma-related admissions average **~5 days**, the longest of all groups, while newborn cases average just **2–3 days**.  
➡️ Monitoring patients with **extended stays may provide early warning signals** for readmission risk.  

---

### 💳 Insurance Coverage  
- **40% of encounters are uninsured**, the largest single group in the dataset.  
- **Medicare covers 32%**, while **Medicaid covers ~5%**.  
- Private insurers (Blue Cross, Aetna, Humana, etc.) each contribute only **3–4%**.  
➡️ The high **uninsured burden** highlights equity concerns and the need for **expanded coverage programs**.  

---

### 🏥 Admission Type Distribution  
- **Emergency = 35%**, **Elective = 26%**, **Urgent = 25%**.  
- **Other/Unknown = 14%**, suggesting data gaps in intake or documentation.  
- **Newborn (0.01%)** and **Trauma Center (0.03%)** are negligible.  
➡️ Hospitals must maintain **strong emergency capacity** while improving **data quality for admissions tracking**.  

---

## ✅ Recommendations  
1. **Expand Insurance Coverage** – Target the uninsured population (~40%) to reduce financial burden and ensure equitable access.  
2. **Prioritize Senior Diabetes Care** – Focus interventions on the 60–80 age group, where readmission rates are highest.  
3. **Improve Emergency Care Capacity** – Given that emergency cases dominate, streamline triage and outpatient referral pathways.  
4. **Leverage LOS Analytics** – Use extended stay duration as an early indicator of readmission risk.  
5. **Strengthen Data Quality** – Reduce reliance on “Other/Unknown” admission categories to improve reporting accuracy.

## ❓ Key Questions for Stakeholders  
- Should readmissions be measured strictly within **30 days**, or also include **60–90 days** for chronic diabetic patients?  
- Do readmissions need to be linked to the **same medical condition** as the prior visit, or any cause?  
- How should **multiple entries within 24 hours** be treated (new encounter vs continuation of prior stay)?  
- What role can **preventive diabetes management programs** play in reducing hospital dependence?  

---

## ⚠️ Assumptions & Caveats  
- Readmission is measured at a **30-day interval**.  
- Dataset is **synthetic but based on real hospital patterns** across 130 US institutions.  
- Cost data was **not included**; analysis instead used stay durations, readmissions, and insurance coverage as proxies.  
- Small categories (Newborn, Trauma) may not generalize due to limited cases.
